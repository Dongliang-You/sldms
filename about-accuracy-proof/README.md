Simulation_of_DNA folder：
	It holds the code that simulates generating DNA sequences 

Get_check_in_and_Simulated_sequencing_data folder：
	sequencing_data：According to the file name selection code, you can generate FASTA or fastq data, 
			 or you can choose whether to generate data with errors
	check_in：It stores the position of the simulated sequencing data in the DNA sequence, 
		  which is used to calculate the accuracy of the software results.

Computational_accuracy folder：
	Store the code used to calculate the accuracy of the results. 
	Through the check of input sequencing check_ In file and the result file obtained by sldms software running the same data to calculate the accuracy of the results.
